This program reads a JSON file and writes the data to a CSV file.
The JSON file contains an array of objects, and each object has two properties: name and code.
The code reads the JSON data, extracts the name and code properties from each object, and writes them to a CSV file.
The CSV file has two columns: header1 and header2, corresponding to the name and code properties, respectively.
